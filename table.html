                Generic is a class which allows the user to define classes and methods with the 
                placeholder. Generics were added to version 2.0 of the C# language. 
                The basic idea behind using Generic is to allow type (Integer, String, â€¦ etc and user-defined types) to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces. A primary limitation of collections is the absence of effective type checking. This means that you can put any object in a collection because all classes in the C# programming language extend from the object base class. This compromises type safety and contradicts the basic definition of C# as a type-safe language. In addition, using collections involves a significant performance overhead in the form of implicit and explicit type casting that is required to add or retrieve objects from a collection. To address the type safety issue, the .NET framework provides generics to create classes, structures, interfaces, and methods that have placeholders for the types they use. Generics are commonly used to create type-safe collections for both reference and value types. The .NET framework provides an extensive set of interfaces and classes in the System.Collections.Generic namespace
                for implementing generic collections.
